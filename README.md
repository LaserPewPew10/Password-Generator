# Password-Generator

# Worked with a group(James Kim, Melissa Mercado, Jessica Perez, Marian Gude and Tiffany Lombardi for the Password generator.

# Started with a list of variables that indicate the specific strings we wanted to place: lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols. 

# Implementd a function to generate a password 

# While implementing a function, I placed variables within the function so there would be a refreshed password whenever you generate.

# Also took out redundant if statements for the parameters of numbers, symbols, caps and lowercase.

# Took out a confirm notation within the for loop that starts at line 70. 

# Implemented a function for the randompull string for it to be returned with random numerical notation. We did this with a return function and placed a math.floor and math.random notation.

# Placed a return password function for it to ultimately run the random generator.
